SETUP:

1. Uses Gradle to load dependencies (check out build.gradle file)


2. Loads in Bluemeix credentials from config.properties file, this file is not pushed but you can create a "config.properties" file in the top level directory of this project, Inside the config.properties file should have this structure

dc_user=YOUR_DOCUMENT_CONVERSION_USER
dc_pw=YOUR_DOCUMENT_CONVERSION_PASSWORD
alchemy_key=YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY


Important note: make sure not to push this config.properties file as it contains sensitive information

3. Main is located in src/main/java/App.java, make sure to put a filepath to a .pdf formated resume in the RESUME_FILEPATH variable at the beginning 

4. Cached Results: in order to not make unnnecessary calls to bluemix, this program tries to save previous results in a cache.
- The cache is stored in the resume-cache directory
- Cached results are indexed by university-name/graduation-year/data-format
- You can clear the cache by  deleting the directory

5. These notes are a bit messy but I do plan to clean them up ASAP

USAGE:

There are four important methods

1. convertToAnswerUnits(resumeFilepath, universityName, graduationYear, checkCache, connection: Returns String
Converts a pdf resume to answer unit format (this format is best for alchemy to extract data from)
resumeFilePath: the filepath to your resume
universityName: the university that the person on the resume attends (this is used for cacheing results)
graduationYear: the year that the person on the resume plans to graduate (this is used for cacheing results)
checkCache: a boolean, set to true to check the cache before making a connection to Bluemix, if the file already exists it will use that file
connection: the bluemix credentials for document conversion

2. convertToNormalizedText(resumeFilepath, universityName, graduationYear, checkCache, connection): Returns String
The same as convertToAnswer Units but returns pure text (not formatted in a json)

3. getRawProfile(jsonParser.parse(answerUnitsResume).getAsJsonObject(), connection) : Returns CombinedResults
Used Alchemy to convert a resume in answer units formatted resume into a "raw profile" 
CombinedResults is a json object consisting of different insights such as keywords, entities, and relations

4. loadCandidate(rawProfile, resumeFilepath, answerUnitsResume, normalizedTextResume): Returns Candidate
This takes in all the information generated by the first three important methods and uses it to build a candidate object
