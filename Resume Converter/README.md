SETUP: These notes are a bit messy but I do plan to clean them up ASAP

1. Uses Gradle to load dependencies (check out build.gradle file)

2 Uses Elastic Search 1.4 available here: https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases

3. Loads in Bluemeix credentials from credentials.properties file, this file is not pushed but you can create a "config.properties" file in the top level directory of this project, Inside the config.properties file should have this structure

dc_user=YOUR_DOCUMENT_CONVERSION_USER

dc_pw=YOUR_DOCUMENT_CONVERSION_PASSWORD

alchemy_key=YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY

Important note: make sure not to push this config.properties file as it contains sensitive information

4. The config.properties file is where you configure how the resume converter runs. It comes with the followng options:
- resume_filepath: the filepath to the resume or resume book to be converted
- document_conversion_number: the version number to use for document conversion
- resume_book_mode: (true or false) whether or not you are converting a resume book
- check_resume_book_cache: (true or false) checks if resume book has been previously split up into individual resumes, if it has then uses the previous results
-resume_book_saving_directory: the path to save and check for a cached resume book
-check_cache: (true or false) whether or not to check previously saved document conversion results
-univeristy_name: the university name from which the resume originates (used for caching)
-graduation_year: the graduation year for which the resume originates (used for caceing)


5. Main is located in src/main/java/App.java, make sure to put a filepath to a .pdf formated resume in the RESUME_FILEPATH variable at the beginning 

6. Cached Results: in order to not make unnnecessary calls to bluemix, this program tries to save previous results in a cache.
- The cache is stored in the resume-cache directory
- Cached results are indexed by university-name/graduation-year/data-format
- You can clear the cache by  deleting the directory


USAGE:

There are four important methods

1. convertToAnswerUnits(resumeFilepath, universityName, graduationYear, checkCache, connection: Returns String
Converts a pdf resume to answer unit format (this format is best for alchemy to extract data from)
resumeFilePath: the filepath to your resume
universityName: the university that the person on the resume attends (this is used for cacheing results)
graduationYear: the year that the person on the resume plans to graduate (this is used for cacheing results)
checkCache: a boolean, set to true to check the cache before making a connection to Bluemix, if the file already exists it will use that file
connection: the bluemix credentials for document conversion

2. convertToNormalizedText(resumeFilepath, universityName, graduationYear, checkCache, connection): Returns String
The same as convertToAnswer Units but returns pure text (not formatted in a json)

3. getRawProfile(jsonParser.parse(answerUnitsResume).getAsJsonObject(), connection) : Returns CombinedResults
Used Alchemy to convert a resume in answer units formatted resume into a "raw profile" 
CombinedResults is a json object consisting of different insights such as keywords, entities, and relations

4. loadCandidate(rawProfile, resumeFilepath, answerUnitsResume, normalizedTextResume): Returns Candidate
This takes in all the information generated by the first three important methods and uses it to build a candidate object
